// 8.2 COUNTING SORT: assumes that each of the n input elements in an
// unsorted array is an integer in the range 0 to k, for some integer k.
// When k is on the order of n, the sort runs in O(n) time.

// Implement countingSort; return the sorted array as well as the
// counting array, C, where C[i] holds the number of elements <= i in
// the original array.

export const countingSort = unsorted => {

};

// 8.3 RADIX SORT:

export const radixSort = () => {

};

// 8.4 BUCKET SORT:

export const bucketSort = () => {

};
