// 8.2 COUNTING SORT: Assumes that each of the n input elements in an
// unsorted array is an integer in the range 0 to k, for some integer k.
// When k is on the order of n, the sort runs in O(n) time.

// Implement countingSort; return the sorted array as well as the
// counting array, C, where C[i] holds the number of elements <= i in
// the original array.

export const countingSort = unsorted => {

  return [null, null];
};

// 8.3 RADIX SORT: take in an unsorted array of integers with d digits.
// Use Radix Sort to sort the numbers.

export const radixSort = (unsorted, d) => {

};

// 8.4 BUCKET SORT: take in an unsorted array of floats in the range of
// [0, 1); it may be assumed that the numbers are uniformly distributed
// within that range. Use the included Link and LinkedList classes to
// implement bucket sort. The LinkedList#sortedInsert method to
// manage buckets.

export const bucketSort = unsorted => {

};
